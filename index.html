											<h2 class="major">Week Two</h2>
											<p>Week Two of our web design course took us deeper into the world of web design by introducing us to personas, outcomes, and exploring the fascinating history of the web, with a specific focus on the evolution of UX design. We began by delving into the concept of personas, which are fictional representations of target users. Personas help us understand and design for our target users, and outcomes, setting clear project objectives.</p>
											<p>One of the highlights of the week was a journey through the history of the web, gaining insights into its evolution, which has shaped modern web design. It was remarkable to witness how far we've come since the early days of the internet. Notably, we examined the progression of UX design, from its early emphasis on usability to the current user-centered, aesthetic, and mobile-responsive approach. This was very relevant to me as I have a key focus on UX design.</p>
											<h3>Key Learnings:</h3>
											<ul>

												<h2 class="major">Week Four</h2>
												<p>I was away for Week Four's class but recently took some time to rewatch and reflect on it. Week three of our web design course concluded the exploration of web history, from 2009 to present day, and discussed notable milestones such as the "Like" button, Google Fonts, and Responsive Web Design. Most importantly, Week Four's class also introduced the concept of User Flows and Customer Journey Maps. User flows and journey maps are essential tools in web design as they help us visualize and understand the user's experience when interacting with a website or application. They are crucial for:</p>
												<ul>
													<li>User-Centered Design</li>
													<li>Identifying Pain Points</li>
													<li>Collaboration</li>
												</ul>
												<h3>Key Learnings:</h3>
												<ul>
													<li>User-Flow Creation</li>
													<li>Journey Mapping</li>

												<h2 class="major">Week Five</h2>
												<p>Week Five was entirely focused on support for the first assignment. Assignment One was a research report as the first building block to our second assignment - to determine our ability to understand users, shape goals for a web product, and plan a user journey. As there were no learnings or goals for the class, I wanted to use this Journal Entry as an opportunity to reflect on my hand-in:</p>
												<p>The feedback from Shiv was constructive and raised valid points regarding my project.</p>

												<p>The acknowledgment of a clear understanding of the user persona and the challenges they encounter was a positive aspect - however, the suggestion to elaborate on the goals and how the website would address these issues is valid. Providing more detailed insights into the strategies and features that will address the user's struggles would enhance my project's quality. Additionally, the observation about the similarity between my user flow and the exemplar, as opposed to following the structure mentioned in the lectures, is crucial. It indicates a need for further alignment with the course content and a deeper exploration of the specific principles taught in the lectures, as I did find myself straying away.</p>

												<p>The absence of an appropriate customer journey map was a significant gap in my project, as a journey map is vital for comprehensively understanding the user's experiences and interactions with the website. In summary, the feedback rightly highlights both strengths and areas for improvement within my project, and was valuable to learn for future submissions.</p>

												<h2 class="major">Week Six</h2>
												<p>Week 6 was a pivotal moment in our web design course, where we explored the critical aspects of color, typography, and the brief for Assignment Two. Our exploration of color schemes, accessibility, typography, and color harmony underscored their importance in web design - like the impact of color and typography on user experience, the significance of accessibility for creating inclusive designs, and the nuances of achieving color harmony for aesthetics and readability.</p>
												<p>We also got to critique an existing design, which was a valuable exercise as it exposed us to real-world examples, enabling us to discern both effective and flawed design choices, and providing us with insights on what to emulate and avoid in our own projects.</p>
												<h3>Key Learnings:</h3>
												<ul>
													<li>Colour and User Experience</li>
													<li>Importance of Accessibility for Inclusive Design</li>
													<li>The Role of Typography and Colour Harmony</li>
												</ul>
												<h3>Goals:</h3>
												<p>My goals moving forward are to create web designs that prioritize accessibility, usability, and aesthetics, incorporating typography and color harmoniously.</p>

												<h2 class="major">Week Seven</h2>
												<p>In Week Seven, we ventured into the practical aspect of designing and building websites, covering essential design principles such as grids, visual hierarchy, scale, white space, composition and balance etc. Additionally, our exploration of mental models and affordances introduced the cognitive and interactive aspects of web design.</p>
												<p>Mental models refer to the conceptual frameworks or expectations users have about how a system or interface works, while affordances are the perceptible design cues and features that suggest how an object or interface should be used.</p>
												<h3>Key Learnings:</h3>
												<ul>
													<li>Design Principles</li>
													<li>Mental Models in User Perception and Interaction</li>
													<li>Affordances as Design Cues Within User-Friendly Interfaces</li>
												</ul>
												<h3>Goals:</h3>

												<h2 class="major">Week Eight</h2>
												<p>Week Eight's class focused mostly on the Assignment 2.2 Brief, given the previous 2.1 hand-in. So, much like Week Five, I have decided to allocate this journal entry to reflecting on my outcome and the feedback I recieved.</p>
												<p>The feedback from Shiv on my Assignment 2.1 hand-in was both constructive and encouraging. It acknowledged the strength of my wireframes in terms of illustrating the development process and highlights the robust design decisions outlined in the report. The suggestion to improve the visual execution, particularly by experimenting with button sizes, box colors, and element spacing, is a valid point. It underscores the importance of not only conceptualizing design decisions but also ensuring that they are aesthetically appealing and user-friendly in their implementation.</p>
												<p>Overall, the positive tone of the feedback was motivating, and the constructive criticism is valuable for refining my design skills and ensuring that my future work combines strong concepts with visually pleasing executions.</p>
												<p>Moving forward in this course, I will begin to implement my Assignment 2.1 website plan into HTML/CSS or a CMS, for Assignment 2.2.</p>

Neglecting responsive design can result in poor user experiences and potentially drive users away. Additionally, efficient file organization is pivotal for web design projects. Well-structured file organization improves collaboration, eases debugging, and streamlines the maintenance of a website. Neglecting this aspect can lead to confusion, errors, and increased development time.</p>
												<h3>Key Learnings:</h3>
												<ul>
													<li>Responsive Design Significance</li>
													<li>Efficient File Organization</li>
												</ul>
												<h3>Goals:</h3>
												<p>My goals from Week Nine include mastering responsive design principles to create websites that adapt seamlessly to different devices, improving user experience and search engine rankings. I aim to implement efficient file organization methods in my projects, fostering better collaboration and streamlining development processes, ultimately enhancing the quality of my work.</p>

												<h2 class="major">Week Ten</h2>
												<p>Week Ten focused on support for Assignment 2.2's hand-in, which involved implementing a design into a CMS. In reflecting on my experience with this submission, I must admit that it was a bit of a rollercoaster. I began the project with a sense of enthusiasm and determination. I was excited about implementing the meticulously crafted design into the CMS, thinking it would be a great opportunity to showcase my skills and creativity. However, as I delved deeper into the project, I encountered numerous complexities and roadblocks that drained my motivation.</p>

												<p>The transition from the design phase to the practical implementation was a bit of challenge. I had quite a bit of experience coding, but decided to give the CMS a go - and to be honest I found myself wrestling with the technical intricacies of integrating design elements and ensuring that the website would function seamlessly.</p>

												<p>I also realized that these moments of frustration and the dissfatisaction with my hand-in were part and parcel of the learning process. They provided opportunities to identify my weaknesses, acknowledge areas for improvement, and reevaluate my strategies for future projects. I learned that setbacks can be valuable teachers, offering insights that contribute to my growth as a web designer and developer.</p>

												<p>Moving forward, my goal is to maintain a positive perspective and consider these challenges as stepping stones rather than obstacles. I'll break down complex tasks into more manageable steps, seek more guidance when necessary, listen to feedback and remember that each setback ultimately leads to a more resilient and skilled future-me in the realm of web design!</p>

												<h2 class="major">Weeks Eleven & Twelve</h2>
												<p>The final weeks involved a course recap and a dedication to the third and final assignment, the one I am working on right now. This assignment, requiring a series of blogs throughout the course, has a significant importance in the context of our web design learning journey. From a critical perspective, this assignment serves several essential roles:</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Reflection and Learning Consolidation</li>
													<li>Documentation of Progress</li>
													<li>Communication and Expression</li>
													<li>Accountability and Time Management</li>
													<li>Engagement in Class & With Peers</li>
												</ul>
												<p>However, while the assignment has many merits, it can also pose challenges. The regularity of producing content can be demanding, especially during weeks when motivation wanes or other commitments pile up.</p>

												<p>To conclude my final journal entry, the importance of the assignment lies in its role as a tool for reflection, documentation, communication, skill development, and community building. Embracing the challenges that may arise during its execution is an essential part of the learning journey and personal growth.</p>
